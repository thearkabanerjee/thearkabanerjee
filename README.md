### thearkabanerjee

Just a guy who loves open source and loves to build performant projects to make my developer workflow better and ultimately craft some really great software.

### What I’m working on

Right now I’m deep into systems programming, terminal tools, automation projects, and strengthening on top of my fundamentals across CS, math, and system-level. You get a glimpse of everything I am doing if you stalk my Github well.

### Nerd Alert

Keyboards: Currently jumping between laptop keys and whatever mechanical keyboard I can get my hands on (really love Cherry MX Brown switches thou)

Editor: Neovim / VS Code

Interests: operating systems, dev tooling, backend, web3, blockchain, and anything that catches my attention.

## The vibe

Work hard, bullish to build cool things that make the young me proud.
