### thearkabanerjee

Just a guy who loves open source and building fast systems, better tools, and a workflow I can be proud of.

### what I’m working on

Interests: operating systems, system level, dev tooling, full stack, web3, blockchain, and anything that catches my attention. You get a glimpse of everything I am doing if you stalk my Github well.

### nerd alert

Keyboards: Currently jumping between laptop keys and whatever mechanical keyboard I can get my hands on (really love Cherry MX Brown switches thou)

### the vibe

Work hard, bullish to build cool things that make the young me proud.
