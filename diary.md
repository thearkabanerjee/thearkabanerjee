this is just a diary for the whole thing. 

i have personally added a lot of things , i think i could have also added the frameworks and other skills i have but i think those will just make things more and more clumpsy.



i have added some really crappy code to make the zed code editor work, but i think if it works, it works..


i think i am happy with what i have finished the github readme with but yeah looking forward to add more and more skills with each day passing
